# meteor-multiapp
meteor-multiapp is an interactive batch script to turn on multiple meteor apps locally, sharing a single MongoDB connection. This is pertty useful when you want to separate your code into multiple applications, say splitting into desktop and a mobile version, or even separating the admin section instead of checking permissions all over in a single app. 

meteor-multiapp helps you save time by running such multiple apps, and at the same time ensuring MongoDB is shared between them.
Run once and watch all your apps start up! 

### TODO
Add a shell script version.

Add more interactivity - make it a single file version which'll take CLI arguments
for other meteor apps to start.
